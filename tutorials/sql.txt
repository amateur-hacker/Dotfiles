To list all the users in the system for mariadb or mysql:

select user from mysql.user
system clear to clear mysql screen or to go to top can enter Ctrl+l

Exiting the shell
exit; or quit; or \q or type ctrl-c

# To change the root user password
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '262004';
flush privileges;

Some Basic Commands or Query:

# Creating Database:
CREATE DATABASE <name>;

Example:
CREATE DATABASE soap_store;
CREATE DATABASE DogApp;

CREATE DATABASE My App;  = No Recommended

CREATE DATABASE hello_world_db; == We use capitalize letter to signify what comes from sql what is custom names.

# To Delete a Database:
DROP DATABASE <name>;

#Example:
DROP DATABASE hello_world_db;
DROP DATABASE soap_store;
DROP DATABASE DogApp;

# Time To Use Database By using use keyword:
USE <database_name>;

#Example:
USE hello_world_db;
USE soap_store;
USE DogApp;

#To check what database we are using currently you can use this command or query:
SELECT database();

#Note : If no database is selected then it will print NULL.

#Tables 
The true heart of SQL.
A database is just a bunch of tables.
Tables holds the data.
"A collection of related data held in a structured format within a database."

# Quick example using cats.
The cat's table!
Name : blue, rocket, monty, sam
Breed: Scottish Fold, Persian, Tabby, Munchkin
Age: 1, 3, 10, 5 

Columns(headers)
Name | Breed | Age

Rows(the actual data)
Blue | Scottish Fold | 1
Rocket | Persian | 3 
Monty | Tabby | 10
Sam | Munchkin | 5

Databases are made up of lots of tables.

# Tables pt. 2
Data Types:
In cat table:
Name must be specified as a text.
Breed must be specified as a text.
Age must be specified as a number.

# In reality, there are a lot of different MySQL data types.

#Numeric Types:
INT
SMALLINT
TINYINT
MEDIUMINT
BIGINT
DECIMAL 
NUMERIC
FLOAT
DOUBLE
BIT


#String Types:
CHAR
VARCHAR
BINARY
VARBINARY
BLOB
TINYBLOB
MEDIUMBLOB
LONGBLOB
TEXT
TINYTEXT
MEDIUMTEXT
LONGTEXT
ENUM

#Date Types:
DATE
DATETIME
TIMESTAMP
TIME
YEAR


#INT 
A whole number with a maxium value of 4294967295
Example:
12, 0, 42, -9999, 3145677

#VARCHAR
A variable length string between 1 and 255 characters.

#Example:
'coffee!'
'aAbbb akljsd'
'-9999'
'L'
'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'


#In cat table 
Name must be specified as varchar(100)
Breed must be specified as varchar(100)
Age must be specified as int


# Draw a Tweets Table:
At a minimum the columns must include.

A username (max 15 chars)
The tweet content (max 140 chars)
Numbers of favorites

Note: Make sure to specify correct MySQL datatypes!.


# Creating Tables:
Syntax:

CREATE TABLE tablename
  (
    column_name data_type,
    column_name data_type
  );

To Check the existing tables:
SHOW TABLES;

To print column from table:
SHOW COLUMNS FROM <tablename>;
or 
DESC <tablename>; (DESC means DESCRIBE)

#Deleting Tables:
DROP TABLE <tablename>;

#Time for another activity:
Create a pastries table
> It should include 2 columns: name and quantity. Name is 50 characters max.
> Inspect your table/columns ini the CLI.
> Delete your table.

Mysql:

Question1: What is a database?
Ans:
i. A collection of data.
Ex: A phone book.
Find Ned Flanders' Phone Number
Find People With First Name "Ned"
Find All Phone Numbers With Area Code 415
Find All People Who Have a 3-letter First Name 

ii. A method for accessing and manipulating that data. 


Question2: Why do they matter?
Ans:


Database Vs Database Management System (DBMS)

Your App > DBMS > Database 


DBMS > Database

PostgreSQL  MySQL
Oracle Database SQLite

these 4 things are not databases, these are DBMS.

Question3: What is a Database?
Ans:
A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.

MySQL
vs.
SQL

Let's start with SQL which stands for Structured Query Language.
SQL is the language which we use to "talk" to our databases.
Let's take an example.
With a human eye code not with an actual SQL Code.
"Find All Users"
"Find All Users Who Are 18 Years Old"
"Add A New User With Username 'Sachin'"
"Delete Every Single User!"

A Quick Preview!
Find All Users Who Are 18 or Older
In SQL Code we call it query.
Select * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18;

Working With MySQL Is Primarily Writing SQL.

### Relational Databases
MySQL
SQLite            ===> All Use SQL 
PostgreSQL
Many Others

Comaprison between two DBMS MySQL Vs. PostgreSQL
In MySQL:
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18;
In PostgreSQL:
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18;
Note: They both use SQL.
There are slight differences in syntax.
