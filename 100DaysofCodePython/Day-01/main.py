# Day 1 :
# Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String manipulation and variables.

# First Program:
print('Hello world!')

# Use of backslash n (\n):
print("Hello world!\nHello world!\nHello world!")

# Concatenating two strings by using add (+) symbol:
print('Hello' + ' Sachin')

# Note: Space is most important in python programming.

  #print('Hello world') => It will throw an indentation error.

  # Use of input function:
print('Hello '  + input('Enter your name? '))

  #Comments in python:

  # Single line comments(#):

  # The input() method is used to take input by the user.
  # The print() method is used to print anything as you want.

  # Multiline Comments ("""  """):
"""
  		Comment is ignored
  		by the interpretor.
"""

# Variables in python:

# A variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in python has a dataype. Different data types in python are Numbers,  List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.

# Example 1:
name = input('Enter your name: ')
print(name)

# Example 2:
name = input('Enter your name: ' )
length = len(name)
print(length)

# Variable naming:

# Rules to naming a variable:
# 1. You can use underscore(_) in starting and in bottom.
# 2. You can't use number in starting but can use in bottom.
# 3. You can use camel case to naming a variable.
