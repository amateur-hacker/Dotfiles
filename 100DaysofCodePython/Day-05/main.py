# Day 5:
# for loops, range and code blocks:

# for loop with list
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)

# Another for loop with range method:
for number in range(1, 11, 3):
  print(number)

# Example:
total = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
  total += num

print(total):
